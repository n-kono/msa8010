    "    - In a project, scientists needed to analyze reports about opiod to prevent future deaths.\n",
    "    - It has required downloading more than 3,000 PDFs to search for opioid-related deaths.\n",
    "    - They wrote [a program](https://github.com/georgiarichards/opioiddeaths) to automate the data collection task.\n",
    "    - Such a tool is called a ‘web scraper’.\n",
    "    - For this project, they could manually screen and save about 25 case reports every hour. \n",
    "    - Now, the program can save more than 1,000 cases per hour."
